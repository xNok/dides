# Rolling Deployment Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The rolling deployment functionality has been successfully refactored to follow dependency injection principles and separation of concerns. The deployment strategy is now decoupled from the trigger service, making it extensible and testable.

## Architecture Changes

### Before Refactoring
- `TriggerService` contained rolling deployment logic directly
- Tight coupling between deployment strategy and trigger logic
- Difficult to test individual deployment strategies
- Hard to add new deployment strategies

### After Refactoring
- `DeploymentStrategy` interface defines deployment behavior
- `RollingDeployment` struct implements the rolling deployment strategy
- `TriggerService` uses dependency injection to accept any deployment strategy
- Clear separation of concerns and improved testability

## Key Components

### 1. DeploymentStrategy Interface (`strategy.go`)
```go
type DeploymentStrategy interface {
    StartDeployment(record *DeploymentRecord) error
    ProgressDeployment(ctx context.Context, record *DeploymentRecord) (*DeploymentRecord, error)
    IsFailureThresholdExceeded(record *DeploymentRecord) bool
    RollbackDeployment(record *DeploymentRecord) error
}
```

### 2. RollingDeployment Implementation (`rolling_deployment.go`)
- Implements the `DeploymentStrategy` interface
- Contains all rolling deployment specific logic
- Manages batch deployment progression
- Handles failure detection and rollback

### 3. Updated TriggerService (`trigger.go`)
- Now accepts a `DeploymentStrategy` via dependency injection
- Delegates deployment operations to the strategy
- Maintains orchestration concerns (locking, status management)

### 4. Dependency Injection Setup
```go
// Create rolling deployment strategy
rollingStrategy := deployment.NewRollingDeployment(store, inventoryService)

// Inject strategy into trigger service
triggerService := deployment.NewTriggerService(store, locker, rollingStrategy)
```

## Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new deployment strategies (Blue-Green, Canary, etc.)
2. **Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between orchestration and deployment logic
4. **Dependency Injection**: Flexible composition at runtime
5. **Interface-based Design**: Promotes loose coupling

## Future Deployment Strategies

The architecture now supports adding new strategies such as:
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Switch traffic between two identical environments
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout to a subset of users
- **A/B Testing Deployment**: Run multiple versions simultaneously

Example implementations are provided in `examples.go` showing how to add these strategies.

## Migration Impact

- **API Compatibility**: No changes to public APIs
- **Configuration**: Deployment strategy selection can be made at startup
- **Testing**: All existing tests updated to use the new architecture
- **Performance**: No performance impact, same functionality with better design

## Testing

- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ New tests for `RollingDeployment` strategy
- ✅ Updated tests for `TriggerService` with mocked strategies
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility while providing a solid foundation for future deployment strategy implementations.
